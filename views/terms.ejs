            <h2 class="mb-4 text-black">The Easeup Platform Connects Handymen and Clients</h2>
            <p align="justify" class="f-16 text-muted">The Easeup Platform is a web and app-based service that connects
                clients with handymen. Clients are individuals or businesses that need short-term services, also known
                as "tasks," while handymen are businesses that offer these services. Both clients and handymen are
                referred to as "users." If a client and handyman agree on the terms of a task, they form a service
                agreement directly with each other.
                Handymen on the Easeup platform are independent business owners and contractors of clients, not
                employees or agents of Easeup. Easeup does not perform tasks and is not responsible for the work of
                handymen. It operates as an online marketplace that connects clients with handymen who are willing to
                perform various tasks. Easeup does not supervise, direct, or control the work of handymen and does not
                assume any responsibility or liability for their work, including any warranties or guarantees of the
                quality or suitability of their services.
                The Easeup platform may refer to handymen as being licensed, credentialed, "badged," "reliable,"
                "elite," "great value," "background checked," or "vetted," but this simply means that they have
                completed the necessary account registration process or met certain criteria and does not necessarily
                reflect their skills or qualifications. These descriptions are not endorsements or guarantees by Easeup
                and should not be taken as such. They are provided as information for clients to use when evaluating the
                suitability of handymen for the tasks they need. Clients are responsible for making their own decisions
                about the identity and suitability of handymen they choose to work with through the Easeup platform.
                The Easeup platform facilitates connections between users for the completion of tasks, but it is not
                responsible for the performance or communication of users, the quality or timing of tasks, or the
                actions or omissions of any user. Easeup does not control or guarantee the suitability, reliability,
                timeliness, or accuracy of tasks requested or services provided by users, or the communication between
                users, whether online or offline. Easeup also does not endorse or guarantee the accuracy of any ratings
                or reviews provided by users about each other.

            <h2 class="mb-4 text-black">Contract between Clients and Handymen</h2>
            <p align="justify" class="f-16 text-muted">A legally binding contract between a client and a handyman, known
                as a service agreement, is formed when they agree on the terms of a task. The service agreement includes
                the terms set forth in this section of the agreement, the engagement terms agreed upon on the Easeup
                platform, and any other contractual terms agreed upon by the handyman and client, as long as they do not
                conflict with the terms of the service agreement or expand Easeup's obligations or restrict its rights
                under the agreement. Easeup is not a party to any service agreement and the formation of such an
                agreement does not create an employment or other service relationship between Easeup and the handyman or
                between the client and the handyman. Users do not have the authority to enter into contracts on behalf
                of Easeup.
            </p>
            <p align="justify" class="f-16 text-muted">Handymen may engage assistants, helpers, subcontractors, or other
                personnel to help them perform tasks, as long as they have been registered through the Easeup platform
                and the client has approved their involvement. The handyman is responsible for the actions and omissions
                of these assistants and for paying their compensation, benefits, and expenses, as well as any required
                tax withholdings. Clients are responsible for confirming that any assistants are registered handymen on
                the platform.
            </p>
            <p align="justify" class="f-16 text-muted">Clients have the discretion to decide whether they will be
                present when a task is being performed or not. If someone else books the task on their behalf or is
                present in their place, they are appointing that person as their agent and the handyman may take
                direction from them as if it were coming from the client. If a client's agent is accessing and using the
                Easeup platform on behalf of a client, they must have the authority to act as the client's agent and
                bind them to the terms of the platform. The client's agent may waive the client's scoping, direction, or
                instruction of the handyman's work or the task performance in the client's stead. The client is
                responsible and liable for any direction or waivers made by their agent as if they had made them
                themselves. The client is also responsible for the actions and omissions of their agent. Client's agents
                are not covered under the Happiness Pledge. The client is required to pay the handyman in full for all
                task services through the specified payment service provider at the agreed upon rates. Both the client
                and the handyman must adhere to the terms of the service agreement and this agreement during the task
                engagement, performance, and completion
            </p>
            <h2 class="mb-4 text-black">Billing and Payment</h2>
            <p align="justify" class="f-16 text-muted">Users of the Easeup Platform can contract with other users for
                tasks, but Easeup is not a party to these contracts. Clients are responsible for paying for all tasks
                through the Easeup Platform using the third party payment service provider (PSP). Easeup is not
                responsible for compensating Handymen for Client's failure to pay for services. The Task Payment,
                service charge, and Trust & Support fee must be paid through the PSP, and Clients on the platform will
                need to provide payment method details to Easeup and the PSP. Handymen must accurately invoice Clients
                within 24 hours of work being performed, including any out-of-pocket expenses and any applicable service
                charge or Trust & Support fee assessed by Easeup. Clients may also be charged credit card processing
                fees if expenses exceed a certain amount. Handymen are responsible for paying registration fees and
                repaying any erroneous payments.
            </p>
            <p align="justify" class="f-16 text-muted">Handymen must create an account with the PSP in order to receive
                payment for their services. By accepting these terms of service, Handymen agree to the PSP Services
                Agreement, which outlines the terms of the payment process. Easeup is not a party to the PSP Services
                Agreement and is not responsible for any issues that may arise in the payment process. In order to
                protect user information and prevent fraud, Easeup and the PSP may validate accounts before activation
                and before each booking by placing temporary charges on the user's account, which will be refunded
                within 1-5 business days. These charges may vary based on the estimated value of the Task. When a Client
                receives confirmation that a Task has been completed, they authorize the PSP to process the Invoice(s).
                Clients may be charged a one-hour cancellation fee at the Handyman's hourly rate if they book a Task but
                cancel it before the scheduled time for the service.
            </p>
            <p align="justify" class="f-16 text-muted">Easeup reserves the right to hold, refund, or provide credits for
                Task Payment, out of pocket expenses, tips, or gratuities if requested by the Client or Handyman or if
                there is potential fraud, unauthorized charges, or other misuse of the platform. Users may be
                responsible for paying taxes or similar charges on tasks and fees, and Easeup may issue receipts or
                documentation to facilitate accurate tax reporting in the country.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mb-4 text-black">Contests, Gift Cards, and Promotional Codes</h2>
            <p align="justify" class="f-16 text-muted">Easeup may occasionally offer promotional opportunities and
                contests to users. These promotions will be managed solely by Easeup and may be altered or removed at
                any time without prior notice. Any liability that Easeup or its affiliates or corporate partners may
                have as a result of these promotions and contests will be subject to the limitations outlined in section
                17 of the terms of service. Easeup gift cards and promotional codes may be used to pay for task payments
                and Easeup service charges and Trust & Support fees, but they cannot be used to pay for reimbursement of
                out-of-pocket expenses or tips for tasks completed through the Easeup platform.
